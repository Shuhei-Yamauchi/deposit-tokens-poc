      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This Proof of Concept (PoC) is built based on our whitepaper:
        <a href="https://shuhei-yamauchi.github.io/deposit-tokens-comparison/" target="_blank">
          Comparison and Implementation Feasibility of Backed Deposit Tokens and Native Deposit Tokens
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whitepaper discusses two approaches for tokenizing bank deposits:
        <strong>Backed Deposit Tokens</strong> and <strong>Native Deposit Tokens</strong>.
        In real-world implementations, the chosen model typically cannot be changed mid-operation.
        Our PoC simulates a transfer between two branches and demonstrates how the Core Banking System (CBS)
        ledger and the Token ledger update differently depending on the model.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <em>Backed Model</em>, the CBS ledger and the Token ledger are maintained separately.
        A transfer involves burning tokens from the source and minting tokens for the destination.
        In the <em>Native Model</em>, a single unified ledger is used so that transfers are reflected immediately.
