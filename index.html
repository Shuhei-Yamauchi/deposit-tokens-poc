      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This Proof of Concept (PoC) is based on the following whitepaper:
        <a href="https://shuhei-yamauchi.github.io/deposit-tokens-comparison/" target="_blank">
          <strong>Comparison and Implementation Feasibility of Backed Deposit Tokens and Native Deposit Tokens</strong>
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whitepaper discusses two main approaches to tokenizing bank deposits:
        <em>Backed Deposit Tokens</em> and <em>Native Deposit Tokens</em>.
        We built this PoC to illustrate how these two models differ in practice.
        By interacting with the simulation, you can see how the Core Banking System (CBS) ledger
        and the Token ledger behave in each model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Backed Model:</strong> The CBS ledger and the Token ledger are maintained separately.
        Transfers involve burning tokens from the sender and minting them for the receiver,
        while the CBS ledger is updated independently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Native Model:</strong> A single unified ledger is used, so transfers are reflected
        simultaneously without needing separate burn/mint steps.
